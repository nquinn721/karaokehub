# Facebook Graph API Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The Facebook parser was failing with "This browser is not supported" error because it was using Puppeteer web scraping, which Facebook actively blocks with anti-bot detection.

## Solution Implemented

Replaced `extractProfileKaraokeData()` method to use **Facebook Graph API** instead of Puppeteer web scraping.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `extractProfileKaraokeData()` Method

- **Before**: Used Puppeteer to scrape Facebook pages (blocked by Facebook)
- **After**: Uses Graph API with configured app credentials for legitimate access

### 2. Graph API Integration

- Uses existing app credentials: `authAppId: 646464114624794`, `parserAppId: 1160707802576346`
- Leverages `getAppAccessToken()` method for authentication
- Calls multiple Graph API endpoints for comprehensive data

### 3. Data Sources Used

```typescript
// Profile/Page Information
GET /{page-id}?fields=name,about,bio,description,location,fan_count,followers_count

// Recent Posts
GET /{page-id}/posts?fields=message,story,created_time,place&limit=50

// Events (existing method)
GET /{page-id}/events?fields=name,description,start_time,place,owner
```

### 4. Content Parsing

Added intelligent parsing methods:

- `extractVenueFromContent()` - Finds venue names in posts
- `extractTimeFromContent()` - Extracts show times
- `extractDayFromContent()` - Identifies days of shows
- `getTimeAgo()` - Formats post timestamps

## Benefits

### ✅ Reliability

- No more "browser not supported" errors
- Uses Facebook's official API instead of scraping
- Legitimate access with proper app permissions

### ✅ Better Data Quality

- Higher confidence scores (0.9 for Graph API data vs 0.8 for scraped)
- Structured data from API vs unstructured HTML parsing
- Access to additional metadata (event IDs, attendance counts)

### ✅ Performance

- Faster than Puppeteer (no browser launch overhead)
- No anti-detection measures needed
- Concurrent API calls possible

### ✅ Compliance

- Uses Facebook's intended method for accessing page data
- Respects platform terms of service
- Proper authentication and permissions

## Testing

### Test Graph API Access

```bash
cd "d:\Projects\KaraokeHub"
node test-facebook-graph-api.js
```

### Test in Production

The `extractProfileKaraokeData()` method will now:

1. Extract profile ID from Facebook URL
2. Get app access token
3. Fetch profile info, posts, and events via Graph API
4. Parse content for karaoke-related information
5. Return structured data with high confidence scores

## Fallback Strategy

If Graph API access fails:

- Method throws descriptive error with API response details
- Logs specific error messages for debugging
- No longer falls back to Puppeteer (which doesn't work anyway)

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual Facebook page URLs
2. Monitor API usage and rate limits
3. Add more sophisticated venue/time parsing patterns
4. Consider caching API responses to reduce quota usage

## Environment Variables Required

```
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=<auth_app_secret>
FACEBOOK_PARSER_APP_SECRET=<parser_app_secret>
```

This implementation fully leverages the Facebook app that was created with "manage everything on your page, embed fb and access threads" permissions, providing legitimate and reliable access to Facebook page data for karaoke event parsing.
