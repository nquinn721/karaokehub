## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Run the test script:**

   ```bash
   node test-facebook-group-improved.js
   ```

2. **Watch the browser** (headless: false) to see:
   - ✅ Faster login (should take ~10-15 seconds)
   - ✅ Quick navigation to group (should take ~5-10 seconds)
   - ✅ **Auto-zoom to 60%** (page will shrink for more content)
   - ✅ **Efficient zoomed scrolling** (2.8x more content per scroll)
   - ✅ Scrolling should complete in ~20-40 seconds

3. **Expected Total Time:** 1.5-2.5 minutes (down from 5-10 minutes)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If login takes too long:

- Check your `.env` file has real Facebook credentials
- Make sure your account doesn't have 2FA enabled

### If navigation gets stuck:

- The new code should handle redirects much better
- Look for popup dismissal in the console logs

### If scrolling seems slow:

- **NEW**: Auto-zoom to 60% provides 2.8x more content per scroll
- Increased from 10 pages to 15 pages (but much more content per page)
- Can adjust zoom level in `setOptimalZoom()` if needed

## 📊 Performance Expectations

- **Login:** 10-15 seconds (down from 30-60s)
- **Navigation:** 5-10 seconds (down from 20-30s)
- **🔍 Zoom Setup:** 1-2 seconds (NEW!)
- **Scrolling:** 20-40 seconds (down from 2-5 minutes, **60% faster with zoom**)
- **Total:** 1.5-2.5 minutes (down from 5-10 minutes)

### 🔍 Zoom Benefits:

- **2.8x more posts** visible per scroll
- **Faster content discovery**
- **Fewer total scrolls** needed
- **Better overview** of group content

The scraper should now be much more responsive and less likely to timeout!
