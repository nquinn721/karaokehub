# ðŸŽµ Music Store Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully cleaned up the MusicStore by removing hardcoded songs and implementing dynamic Spotify API integration with liked song prioritization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Featured Categories Structure

**Before**: Hardcoded arrays of 100+ specific song titles per category

```typescript
{
  id: 'karaoke-classics',
  title: 'Karaoke Classics',
  image: '/images/music/karaoke-classics.png',
  queries: [
    "Don't Stop Believin'",
    'Sweet Caroline',
    // ... 98+ more hardcoded songs
  ]
}
```

**After**: Dynamic Spotify query-based categories

```typescript
{
  id: 'karaoke-classics',
  title: 'Karaoke Classics',
  image: '/images/music/karaoke-classics.png',
  spotifyQuery: 'karaoke classics hits most popular sing along',
  description: 'Top 100 karaoke classics that everyone loves to sing'
}
```

### 2. Enhanced loadCategoryMusic Method

- **Removed**: Hardcoded query cycling through predefined song lists
- **Added**: Direct Spotify API queries using optimized search terms
- **Added**: Liked song prioritization - user favorites appear at the top
- **Added**: Dynamic pagination with 50-100 songs per request
- **Added**: Better error handling and loading states

### 3. Improved getSuggestions Method

- **Removed**: 50+ hardcoded popular song suggestions
- **Added**: User favorites prioritization in autocomplete
- **Added**: Dynamic Spotify API suggestions
- **Added**: Fallback to minimal karaoke classics only when API fails

### 4. Added Liked Song Prioritization

```typescript
// Prioritize liked songs at the top
const favoriteSongs = songFavoriteStore.getFavoriteSongs();
const likedSongIds = new Set(favoriteSongs.map((song) => song.spotifyId || song.id));

const likedSongs = newSongs.filter((song) => likedSongIds.has(song.id));
const nonLikedSongs = newSongs.filter((song) => !likedSongIds.has(song.id));

// Combine with liked songs first
this.songs = this.deduplicateSongs([...likedSongs, ...nonLikedSongs]);
```

## New Category Configurations
