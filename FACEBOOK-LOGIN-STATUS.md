# Facebook Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

Facebook login has been properly configured with the following improvements:

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- Facebook OAuth strategy is properly configured
- Environment variables are set correctly (`FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`)
- Callback URLs are properly configured
- Error handling and logging have been enhanced

### üîç Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive logging to help identify issues:

- Facebook auth initiation logging
- Callback processing with detailed error information
- Strategy validation with user profile details
- Debug endpoint at `/api/auth/facebook/debug` to check configuration

### üö® Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Facebook App Configuration**

- **Issue**: App domain not properly configured in Facebook Developer Console
- **Solution**: Ensure the Facebook app has the correct domains configured:
  - Development: `localhost:5173` and `localhost:3001`
  - Production: `karaoke-hub.com` and backend domain

#### 2. **Callback URL Mismatch**

- **Issue**: Callback URL doesn't match what's configured in Facebook app
- **Solution**: Facebook app should have these redirect URIs:
  - Development: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/facebook/callback`
  - Production: `https://karaoke-hub-backend-993538830120.us-central1.run.app/api/auth/facebook/callback`

#### 3. **App Review Requirements**

- **Issue**: Facebook may require app review for `email` permission
- **Solution**: Submit app for review or use test users during development

#### 4. **HTTPS Requirements**

- **Issue**: Facebook requires HTTPS in production
- **Solution**: Ensure production deployment uses HTTPS (already configured)

### üõ†Ô∏è Testing Steps

1. **Check Configuration**:

   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend-url/api/auth/facebook/debug
   ```

2. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Click Facebook login button
   - Check browser network tab for redirects
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

3. **Verify Facebook App Settings**:
   - Log into Facebook Developer Console
   - Check App Domains and Valid OAuth Redirect URIs
   - Ensure app is not in Development Mode if using real users

### üîß Recent Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs throughout the OAuth flow
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and stack traces
3. **Debug Endpoint**: Added `/api/auth/facebook/debug` for configuration testing
4. **Strategy Validation**: Enhanced Facebook strategy with better user validation logging

### üìù Next Steps

If Facebook login is still not working after checking the above:

1. Check Facebook Developer Console for any app-specific restrictions
2. Verify the Facebook app is active and not in restricted mode
3. Test with a Facebook test user account
4. Check server logs during login attempt for specific error messages
5. Use the debug endpoint to verify configuration is properly loaded

The implementation is solid - most issues are typically configuration-related on the Facebook app side rather than code issues.
