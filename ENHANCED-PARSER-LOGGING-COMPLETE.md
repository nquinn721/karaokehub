### 2. **Screenshot Saving**

- ✅ **Enabled**: Screenshots now saved to `temp/facebook-group-screenshot-{timestamp}.png`
- 📸 **Logging**: Shows full path when screenshot is saved

### 3. **Worker Management & Creation**

```
🔧 Setting up worker processing: 45 images, 15 batches, 3 images per batch
⚡ Creating 3 workers for batch 1
🔨 Starting worker 1 for image 1
🔨 Starting worker 2 for image 2
🔨 Starting worker 3 for image 3
📊 Active workers: 3, Total created: 3
```

### 4. **Individual Worker Lifecycle**

```
🔨 Worker created for image 5 (https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808...)
✅ Worker completed in 2.3s for image 5
❌ Worker failed in 5.1s for image 8: API rate limit exceeded
⏰ Worker timeout after 30.0s for image 12
💥 Worker error after 1.2s for image 15: Network connection failed
```

### 5. **Batch Processing Statistics**

```
✅ Batch 1 completed, 0 workers still active
📈 Batch 1 summary: 2 successful, 1 failed
🎯 Batch 1 found: 2 shows, 1 DJs, 1 vendors
⏳ Pausing 2s before next batch to respect rate limits...
```

### 6. **Image Download Progress**

```
📦 Starting download of 45 images...
📥 Downloading image 1/45: https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808...
✅ Image 1 downloaded successfully (234KB)
❌ Image 3 download failed: HTTP 403: Forbidden

## 🎯 What This Shows You

### **If you see low image counts:**

- Check DOM scan results - are images being filtered out?
- Look at size filtering - are images too small?
- Check download success rate - are images failing to download?

### **If you see worker failures:**

- Check individual worker timings for patterns
- Look for API rate limits or network issues
- Monitor active worker counts for resource usage

### **If you see low show counts despite good extraction:**

- Check individual worker results for what's being found
- Look at batch summaries to see where shows are lost
- Check validation worker logs for filtering issues

### **Screenshot Debugging:**

- Screenshots automatically saved with timestamps
- Can manually review what the parser is seeing
- Helps verify login state and content visibility

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Worker Lifecycle**: Full tracking from creation to completion
- **Batch Statistics**: Shows exactly what each batch finds
- **Download Monitoring**: Progress tracking with file sizes
- **Error Categorization**: Different error types clearly identified
- **Performance Metrics**: Worker timing and throughput data

This comprehensive logging will help you identify exactly where the bottleneck is in getting more than 27 shows!
