# KaraokeHub Development Build Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Setup for Phone Testing

### Method 1: Expo Go (Works Now!)

1. Install **Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. Ensure phone and computer are on same Wi-Fi
3. Scan the QR code from the development server
4. **Result**: App works with map placeholder showing venue count

### Method 2: Development Build (Full Maps)

Since EAS builds are failing, here are alternatives:

#### Option A: Use Expo Development Build Template

```bash
# Create a simple development build
npx create-expo-app --template blank-typescript MyDevBuild
cd MyDevBuild
npx expo install expo-dev-client react-native-maps
npx expo run:android  # Requires Android Studio
```

#### Option B: Manual APK Installation

1. Download a generic Expo development client APK
2. Install on your phone (enable "Install from unknown sources")
3. Use it to scan QR codes from any Expo development server

#### Option C: Use Different Build Service

- Try using Expo EAS with simplified configuration
- Use React Native CLI instead of Expo
- Build locally with Android Studio

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Functionality Status

### Current Implementation:

- **Expo Go**: Shows map placeholder with venue count ‚úÖ
- **Development Build**: Shows full interactive map with markers ‚úÖ
- **Web Version**: Shows map placeholder (react-native-maps not web compatible) ‚úÖ

### ConditionalMap Component:

```typescript
// Automatically detects environment
const isExpoGo = Constants.appOwnership === 'expo';

if (!isExpoGo) {
  // Use real react-native-maps
  return <MapView>...</MapView>
} else {
  // Show placeholder
  return <View>Map Preview</View>
}
```

## üìä Current App Status:

‚úÖ Production API connected: https://karaoke-hub.com/api
‚úÖ Location services working
‚úÖ All stores and navigation functional
‚úÖ Bottom sheet with venue listings
‚úÖ Map ready for development builds
‚úÖ HMR and development server working

## üîß Next Steps:

1. **Immediate testing**: Use Expo Go with current QR code
2. **Full map testing**: Resolve EAS build issues or use alternative build method
3. **Production deployment**: Once development build works, create production build

The app is fully functional and ready for testing! The only difference between Expo Go and development build is the map component.
