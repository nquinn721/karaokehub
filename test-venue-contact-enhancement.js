ENHANCED INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract any visible contact information from the image
2. **VENUE CONTACT INFO**: For known venues, try to provide phone number and website from your knowledge
3. **VENUE NAME LOOKUP**: Use your knowledge to provide complete venue information including:
   - Full address and coordinates
   - Phone number if known
   - Website URL if known

EXAMPLES:
- **KNOWN VENUE**: "Otie's Tavern & Grille" → lookup: phone: "(614) 889-3030", website: "otiestavern.com"
- **LOCAL LOOKUP**: Use venue name + location context to find contact info

Expected JSON format:
{
  "show": {
    "venue": "${venue.venue}",
    "address": "full address if known",
    "venuePhone": "phone number if known from venue lookup or visible",
    "venueWebsite": "website URL if known from venue lookup or visible",
    "state": "OH",
    "city": "city name",
    "zip": "zip code",
    "lat": "latitude if known",
    "lng": "longitude if known"
  }
}
